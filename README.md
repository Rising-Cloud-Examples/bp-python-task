## Using this boilerplate repository

### Requirements
- Python 3.5+
- Docker (if locally testing)

### Local Testing

There are two ways to test your application locally. You could just
set the request.json to be what you'd like and run `python3 main.py`.
In practice it is a much prefered paradigm to test in a container. The
provided makefile gives simple bindings necessary to create the image,
run the container, and test requests.
